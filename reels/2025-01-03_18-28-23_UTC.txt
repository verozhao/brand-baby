Cozy up for a planet parade!
 
All month in January, look up at the night sky to see Venus, Mars, Saturn, and Jupiter. Mid-month, Venus and Saturn will pass near each other, cozying up on Jan. 17 and 18 before parting ways.
 
Next door, our planetary neighbor, Mars, will reach opposition this month, which happens when the planet lies directly on the opposite side of Earth from the Sun, forming a straight line.
 
On Jan. 3, the Quadrantid meteor shower will peak and be visible through Jan. 12. For those in the Northern Hemisphere, your best viewing options will occur after midnight with clear, dark skies.
 
Happy skywatching!
