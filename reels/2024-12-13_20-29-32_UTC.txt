This timelapse, taken through a window on the International Space Station (@ISS), shows the station’s Canadarm2 and Dextre, its two-armed robotic companion, carefully deploying a materials experiment.
 
MISSE-20-Commercial, the latest research to join the Materials ISS Experiment Flight Facility, holds 12 experiments. One of them, called SEAQUE, is testing technologies that could help quantum communications tools "self-heal" against radiation damage they might encounter in the environment of space. You’ll see Canadarm2 and Dextre move this experiment out of the Kibo laboratory module's airlock and into position as Earth rotates underneath. The sunlight shifts across the window frame, acting like a giant space sundial over the course of the timelapse.
 
Video description: The video is taken from a circular window on the International Space Station. This timelapse shows the two smaller arms on SPDM (the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator) grappling a materials exposure payload (MISSE) and moving it away. The Earth can be seen peeking through the bottom, as the solar panels gradually move following the sunlight.
